Icon in taskbar notification area cleanup ideas
===============================================
when app is starting spawn a new process
this process will only check if app was closed and if so try to cleanup the ghost taskbar icon (RefreshTrayArea) and kill itself
=> now partially solved by RefreshTrayArea which removes icons left over after app killed when starting app

Application icon improvement (if working with NotificationIcon)
===============================================================
potentially, to get correct looking week number icon (not jagged/squewed), create icon using IconFactory instead of single resolution icon as per today
this would then potentially make windows select correct resolution to display from within the icon images in different resolutions
